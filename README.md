# Simple Bleeding for GZDoom

Simple universal bleeding system by Jekyll Grim Payne aka Agent_Ash. Use and modify at will but please credit.

# How to use

Download the code via **Code > Download ZIP**, or just open the zscript.zs file and copy-paste the stuff you need. Note, you will also need MAPINFO to make it work, since the script relies on an event handler, and event handlers have to be added via MAPINFO.

The script is heavily commented; the comments should explain what does what.
